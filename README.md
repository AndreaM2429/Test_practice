# Test practice
I wrote a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) library. 

### About

For this project I create test cases for 4 different tasks:

- **Task 1**

    A function that takes any string as an argument and return the length with the exception of:
    - if the string is at least 1 character long and not longer than 10 characters.

- **Task 2**

    A function that takes an string as an argument and return the reverse string.

- **Task 3**

    A calculator class which contain 4 methods:
    - Add
    - Subtract
    - Divide
    - MultiplY
    The tests of this task are group using `describe()`

- **Task 4**

    **The test of this case was make using TDD.**
    A function that takes a string as an argument and takes the first character of it and capitalize it; the function returns the string with the first character capitalize.
